### Overview of Project:

### Task 1: EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA) on Iris Dataset

# Project Overview:

The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning and statistics. It consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, each with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. These samples are categorized into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The purpose of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Iris dataset to uncover underlying patterns, relationships, and insights.

# Objectives:

Understand the structure and distribution of the dataset.
Visualize the data to identify patterns and relationships.
Summarize key statistics and insights.
Prepare the data for further analysis or modeling.
Steps for EDA:

Loading the Dataset:

Import necessary libraries.
Load the Iris dataset.
Initial Data Inspection:

Display the first few rows of the dataset.
Check for missing values.
Understand the data types and basic statistics.
Summary Statistics:

Calculate and interpret summary statistics for each feature.
Generate a correlation matrix to examine relationships between features.
Data Visualization:

Univariate Analysis:
Histograms and density plots for each feature.
Box plots to identify outliers.
Bivariate Analysis:
Scatter plots to observe relationships between pairs of features.
Pair plot (scatter plot matrix) to visualize pairwise relationships.
Multivariate Analysis:
Violin plots to understand feature distributions across different species.
Heatmaps to visualize correlation matrices.
Insights and Observations:

Highlight key findings from the visualizations and statistics.
Discuss any interesting patterns or anomalies.
Data Preparation:

Handle any missing values (if present).
Normalize or standardize the data if necessary.
Encode categorical variables (if needed).

### Task 2: PREDICTIVE MODELING WITH LINEAR REGRESSION on California Housing dataset

# Project Objective
The primary goal of this project is to develop a predictive model using linear regression to estimate housing prices in California based on various features. By leveraging the California Housing dataset, we aim to understand the relationships between housing prices and different predictors such as median income, housing age, total rooms, total bedrooms, population, households, and latitude and longitude.

# Dataset Description
The California Housing dataset is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community, originating from the 1990 California census. It contains the following columns:

longitude: A measure of how far west a house is; a higher value is farther west.
latitude: A measure of how far north a house is; a higher value is farther north.
housing_median_age: Median age of the house within a block.
total_rooms: Total number of rooms within a block.
total_bedrooms: Total number of bedrooms within a block.
population: Total number of people residing within a block.
households: Total number of households, a group of people residing within a home unit.
median_income: Median income for households within a block.
median_house_value: Median house value for households within a block (target variable).
Steps and Roadmap
Data Collection

Download the California Housing dataset from a reliable source, such as the StatLib repository or via the sklearn.datasets module.
# Data Preprocessing

Handle missing values: Determine and handle any missing data points.
Feature scaling: Normalize or standardize features if necessary.
Feature engineering: Create new features if required to improve model performance.
# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualize the data to understand distributions and relationships.
Use plots such as histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices.
# Splitting the Data

Divide the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.
# Model Development

Implement a linear regression model.
Train the model using the training dataset.
# Model Evaluation

# Model Improvement

Feature selection: Identify and keep the most relevant features.
Regularization: Apply techniques such as Lasso or Ridge regression to prevent overfitting.
# Model Deployment

Deploy the model to a suitable platform if required.
Develop a user interface to input features and output predicted house prices.
# Documentation and Reporting

Document the entire process, findings, and results.
Prepare a detailed report with visualizations, code snippets, and explanations.
# Tools and Technologies
Python: For data manipulation, analysis, and modeling.
Libraries:
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: Numerical computing.

Expected Outcomes
A well-trained linear regression model that can predict housing prices in California with reasonable accuracy.
Insights into the relationships between housing prices and various features in the dataset.
A comprehensive report detailing the methodology, analysis, and results.
